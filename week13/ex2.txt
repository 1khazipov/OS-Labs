3 ways of handling deadlock: recovery, prevention, and avoidance.

Recovery: the operating system breaks the impasse
before attempting to make things right.
The only options are to warn the user, kill the process
(which is contributing to the stalemate), or replace the resource. 

Prevention: solving the problem by preventing one of
the four necessary deadlock conditions.
Every disease has a unique method of prevention. 

Avoidance: is the best because it avoids deadlock
and does not limit resources as much as prevention.
This approach avoids deadlock by using algorithms
to guarantee that the system is always in a safe state.
